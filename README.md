Chicken Run!!!

Chicken run is about a chicken that fled from its cage for a freedom realized that best place to live is the cage. The chicken wants to go back but there are so many dangerous stuff out there. Our job is to guide the chicken back to the cage without getting caught by other animals or other obstacles. 

Users can move the chicken by up, down, right  and left.    Other harmful object can either come from left or right with different rate of speed. After each game, users can store their scores and their name. There will be a section where users can see their previous scores.
